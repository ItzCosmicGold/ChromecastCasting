# ChromecastCasting

👉 Basic Code to Cast Your Screen/Programs on a GoogleCast.
  👉To cast your screen onto a Chromecast device, you typically need to use the Google Cast SDK. Below is a simple example in Python using the pychromecast library, which provides a way to control Chromecast devices from your computer.
  👉This script captures your screen using the pyautogui library and casts it to the specified Chromecast device using the pychromecast library. Make sure to replace "Your Chromecast Name" with the name of your Chromecast device. Additionally, the script plays a sample video (BigBuckBunny.mp4) to initialize the media controller, which is required for casting the screen.

 ⚠️ Please change "ENTER NAME HERE." with the name of the googleCast name. Ensure both the Casting Device and the PC are on the same network.

 ⚠️ NOTE: Install pychromecast and pyautogui installed in your Python environment. (you can install them using pip: pip install pychromecast, pip install pyautogui)
